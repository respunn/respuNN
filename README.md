# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is respuNN, and I'm currently a third-year computer engineering student from Turkey. I am currently continuing my education in Turkey, but until a few months ago I was studying in Poland. Currently I have already worked on small projects in Poland and Italy. I am currently working on a VR game called Illusa with my friends and we are planning to release this game on Steam platform in 1-2 years. I'm passionate about programming and have experience working with Python and C#. I love working on big projects and being a part of a team that creates something meaningful.

## Skills and Expertise

- **Programming Languages:** Python, C#, HTML5, CSS, PHP
- **Bot Development:** Discord bots at an advanced level, Twitch bots at an entry level
- **Design:** Photoshop at an advanced level
- **Video Editing and 3D Modeling:** Premiere Pro and Blender at an entry level
- **Unity:** Working on Animation, VFX, and Scripting on Unity

## Current Projects

- **Illusa VR Game:** When we started developing this VR game, I actually didn't know much about Unity, but we knew that this project would add a lot to us. Taking part in this project allowed me to develop myself a lot, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished so far. I love working on this big project with my college friends and being a part of something that has the potential to make a real impact.
  - **Animation:** I try to create complex animations for Illusa's characters and other objects. In Illusa, I'm trying to create animations for player actions like running, jumping, attacking, and casting spells, as well as for environmental elements like water, weather effects and trying to code Animation Controller for player and each NPC.
  - **VFX:** I try to create stunning visual effects for the Illusa. With VFX, I'm trying to create anything from simple particle effects like smoke and sparks, to more complex effects like explosions, magic spells, and weather effects.
  - **Scripting:** I am trying to little bit scripting in Unity. Trying to help my friends to create custom behaviors and interactions that bring our game mechanics to life. My goal is mastering scripting in Unity for creating a polished and engaging gameplay experience.
- **Respy Project:** Respy is a comprehensive project that aims to provide a range of useful tools and features for Discord users. The project consists of multiple sub-branches, including Lespy, a leveling system bot.
  - **Lespy Sub-Branch:** Lespy is a Discord bot that has a powerful leveling system. The bot listens to messages sent by users and adds 1 XP to their current XP in the database if the message contains certain words defined in the code. If the user reaches the required XP to level up, the bot sends an embed message announcing the user's level-up. Lespy also has many other commands that users can use to interact with the bot. Lespy uses SQLite3 database to store users' XP and level information, and it also has a separate table for admin users. The bot is a great addition to any Discord server and can help incentivize active participation in the community.
  - **Other Sub-Branches (WIP):** In addition to Lespy, the Respy project has many other sub-branches, each with its own set of features and tools. Some examples of other sub-branches include:
    - *Music Bot:* A powerful music bot that allows users to play music in voice channels.
    - *Moderation Bot:* A bot that provides comprehensive moderation tools, including banning, kicking, and muting users.
    - *Games Bot:* A bot that provides a range of fun and interactive games that users can play in the Discord server.


## Hobbies and Interests

- **Algorithm Questions:** I'm interested in algorithm questions and love to solve them. 
- **Learning New Skills:** I'm always looking to expand my skillset and learn new things.
- **Traveling:** When I'm not studying or working on projects, I love to travel and explore new places.
- **Helping Others:** I love helping people with discord bots and all that I know in Unity. It makes me happy to have people jump into the coding and see what they can create.
