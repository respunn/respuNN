### hi
###### My name is respuNN, and I'm currently a third-year computer engineering student from Turkey. I am currently continuing my education in Turkey, but before 2023 I was studying in Poland. Currently I have already worked on small projects in Poland and Italy. I am currently working on a VR game called Illusa with my friends and we are planning to release this game on Steam before 2024.
